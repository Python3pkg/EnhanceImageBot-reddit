What is EnhanceImageBot?

It is a reddit bot to do one single thing: ENHANCE!

In more detail, it finds comments containing only the phrase "ENHANCE!" that are replies to submissions (comments will be supported in the future) with an image (JPEG only for now...). It takes those images and "enhances" it by zooming in 50% and sharpening it. It then uploads the new "enhanced" image to imgur and posts it as a reply to the previous comment.
